SearchItems
Description
The SearchItems operation searches for items on Amazon based on a search query. The Amazon Product Advertising API returns up to ten items per search request.

A SearchItems request requires a search category, which, if not specified, defaults to "All" and value for at least one of Keywords, Actor, Artist, Author, Brand or Title for searching items on Amazon.

SearchItems supports the following high-level resources:

BrowseNodeInfo
Images
ItemInfo
Offers
SearchRefinements
Availability
All locales, however, the parameter support varies by locale.

API Features and Best Practices
You can refine SearchItems request to return the results you want. Try different parameter combinations to customize search results. Moreover, the API helps you refine search requests by giving out dynamic search refinements for every search request you make. These dynamic refinements are available as part of SearchRefinements resource.

You can search by Keywords, Actor, Artist, Author, Brand or Title in any category. However, note that it is mandatory to provide at least one of the above mentioned parameters.
SearchItems API supports many request parameters, most of them help in refining search results. For example, use Brand to refine your search results to return products for a specific brand or use MinPrice to return results having at least one offer price greater than the minimum price specified. However, not all parameters are relevant to all search indices. For example, if you specify the Actor, you would not use the Automotive search index.
Use the SortBy parameter to return results in a specific order. For example Price:HighToLow sorts the result from most expensive to least expensive.
By default, the API searches for products in "All" SearchIndex if not specified. However, use a specific SearchIndex or BrowseNodeId to limit search results by a category or BrowseNode. For a complete list of SearchIndices for a locale, refer Local Reference for Product Advertising API.
